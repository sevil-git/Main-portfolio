          <p>Sigh, the year is about to end in like 3 days, feels like I could've done more. 2023 has been a not-so-good-but-not-so-bad year for me. There were things I couldn't accomplish but there were also a large number of things I did accomplish. In fact I was able to check out most of the stuff from my 2022 checklist and that's a huge accomplishment according to me.

            I did make a lot of memories worth remembering this year, made new friends, lost some friends but in the end none of it really matters except the fact that I survived yet another year. So, in case you want to know what I have been doing, I have been wasting a good amount of time playing GTA5 and apart from that I tried exploring MERN Stack, I haven't been coding consistently tbh but I did try Advent of Code and sadly I lost on day 14 :(
            
            As my First year is going to end, I'm going to spend most of it doing productive things hopefully and spend some time with family since college is closed for holidays. This is it for this time ig, see ya next time -- and wishing you a very happy journey no matter what you're going through, in the it's me/you that matters. Bye.
